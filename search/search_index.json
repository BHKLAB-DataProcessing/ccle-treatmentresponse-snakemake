The CCLE dataset is very large, and kallisto is faster for quantifying large datasets 2. GDSC used kallisto, so we can compare our results with theirs Technical Challenges Record significant problems you encountered and how you solved them ## Sample Name Format Issue [2025-04-25] We encountered a problem with sample name formats between the CCLE and GDSC datasets. The CCLE dataset uses \"BRCA-XX-XXXX\" format, while the GDSC dataset uses \"BRCA-XX-XXXX-XX\". We had to write a script to remove the last two characters from the sample names in the GDSC dataset.
